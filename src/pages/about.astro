    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      This website is my personal "forever home" on the Internet. It contains my bookmarks,
      videos, and papers I've collected, along with my writings and other things I find interesting.
    </p>

    <h2>The System</h2>

    <p>
      Resources are organized using a hierarchical tag system inspired by Wikipedia's category structure.
      Going down one level in the tag tree means zooming into a narrower domain within a field.
    </p>

    <p>
      The classification pipeline uses a combination of tools to automatically categorize resources
      and maintain the health of the tag tree (pruning, merging, splitting tags as needed).
    </p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>
      Much of the point is personal: I'm interested in durably saving my various "arcs" and adventures
      in figuring out what interests me most, and letting this grow over decades.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, I intend to build out more features like research trail visualizations,
      timeline views, and automatic publishing of notes.
